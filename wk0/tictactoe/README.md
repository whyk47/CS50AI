# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

### Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe project implements an AI to play the game optimally using the Minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates possible moves and ensures the best possible outcome for itself, making it unbeatable with perfect play. The AI also uses Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate redundant recursive computations.

### Usage:
1. Install `pygame`
2. Run `runner.py` to start the game's graphical interface.
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python runner.py
```
